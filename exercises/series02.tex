{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .1}} \bigskip 

The field $\R(X)$ can be ordered in more than one way.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Try to find orderings other than the one presented in the lecture that extend the ordering of $\R$. 
	\item Can you describe all such orderings?
\end{enumerate}

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .2}} \bigskip 

Show the following: For a real closed field $R$, the set $\sum R^2$ is the
unique ordering of $R$. Even more specifically, an element of $R$ is non-negative if and
only if it is a square $x^2$ with $x \in R$.

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .3}} \bigskip 

Let $k \in \N$. Is the positive semidefinte cone $\PSD^k_+$ semialgebraic? Is it basic semialgebraic?

\bigskip

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .4}} \bigskip 

Find a quantifier-free formula equivalent to

$$ F(p, q) := \exists x~[~-1 \leq x \leq 1,~ x^2 + px + q = 0~].$$

Draw a sketch of the respective semialgebraic set $S :=  \set{(p, q) \in \R^2 : F(p, q) \text { is \emph{true}} }$. Is it basic semialgebraic?

%
%Show that $f \in \R[X]$ is the zero polynomial if and only if $f = 0$ on $\R^n$ .

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .1}} \bigskip 

Let $m, n \in \N$, let $K \subseteq \R^n$ and $L \subseteq \R^m$ be closed convex cones and let $A \in \R^{m \times n}, c \in \R^n$ and $b \in \R^m$. Consider the problems
	\begin{equation*}
	\alpha := \inf \set{ \sprod{c}{x} \mid x \in K, \ A x - b \in L}
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
	\beta := \sup \set{ \sprod{y}{b} \mid y \in L^\ast, \ c - A^\top y \in K^\ast}.
	\end{equation*}
	Show that the following hold:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item The problems satisfy weak duality. 
		\item If there exists an $x'$ with $x' \in \intr(K)$ and $A x - b \in \intr(L)$, then strong duality holds.
		\item If there exists an $y'$ with $y' \in \intr(L^\ast)$ and $c - A^\top y \in \intr(K^\ast)$, then strong duality holds.
	\end{enumerate}

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .4}} \bigskip 

Consider the SDP
$$\inf \left\{ x~\colon~\begin{pmatrix} 0 & x \\ x & y \end{pmatrix} \ \text{psd},~x  \ge -1 \right\}. $$
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item What is the optimal value of this problem? 
		\item What is the optimal value of its dual?

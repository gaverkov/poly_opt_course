{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .1}} \bigskip 

Consider the polynomial optimization problem

$$ \inf \set{f(x) \mid x \in \R^n} $$

with $f \in \R[X]$.

Show that the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item If $n = 1$ and the infimum is finite, it will be attained at some $x \in \R^n$. 
	\item For every $n \geq 2$, there exists a polynomial $f$ such that the infimum is finite but not attained.
\end{enumerate}

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .2}} \bigskip 

Show that if a matrix $A \in \PSD^k$ is psd, then it can be written as

$$ A = u_1 u_1^\top + \ldots + u_r u_r^\top $$

for finitely many vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_r \in \R^k$.

Can the choice of $r$ be bounded in terms of $k$?

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .3}} \bigskip 

Consider the polynomial

$$ f = 2 + X_1^2 + X_1^2 X_2^4 - 4X_1 X_2.$$

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Show that $f$ is SOS.
	\item Determine a vector $m(X)$ of monomials and a PSD matrix $Z$ with $f = {m(X)}^\top Z m(X)$.
	\item Describe, for your choice of $m(X)$, all PSD matrices $Z$ satisfying $f = {m(X)}^\top Z m(X)$.
\end{enumerate}

{\large \textbf{Exercise \thesheetnumber .4}} \bigskip 

Consider the homogenization

$$ h(X_1, X_2, X_3):= X_3^6 - 3X_1^2 X_2^2 X_3^2 + X_1^2 X_2^4 + X_1^4 X_2^2 $$
of the Motzkin polynomial (called the \emph{Motzkin form}). Show that

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item $f = h(X_1 , 1, X_3 )$ is non-negative.
	\item $f$ is not SOS.
	\item $h(X_1, 1, X_3) + c$ is SOS for some $c \in \R$.
\end{enumerate}
